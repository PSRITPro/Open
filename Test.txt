Hi [Manager’s Name],

I received a follow-up call from Microsoft regarding feedback on one of our recent premium support tickets. During the discussion, I highlighted the following points based on my experience with their support process:

1. Issue Reproduction and Troubleshooting Approach

When Microsoft support engineers are able to reproduce the reported issue in their own environment, they should attempt to resolve it there instead of focusing only on our tenant/environment.

This would save time for both sides and help us receive quicker resolutions without unnecessary back-and-forth.

2. Effort vs. Outcome – “As per Design” Responses

In some cases, after extensive troubleshooting and log collection, the final resolution given is that the behavior is “as per product design.”

I raised the concern that if the outcome was already known to be by design, then collecting detailed logs, traces, and performing lengthy troubleshooting from our side adds unnecessary effort.

My suggestion was that Microsoft should communicate this upfront where possible, instead of asking for time-consuming data collection first.

3. Support Experience Improvement

Overall, my feedback was to make the troubleshooting process more efficient by leveraging their internal test environments where possible.

Also, to avoid redundant efforts on our side, Microsoft support should ensure that data collection requests are strictly necessary and will contribute to identifying a fix or workaround.

These were the main points I conveyed during the call. The intention was to provide constructive feedback so that future interactions with Microsoft support are more effective and less time-consuming for us.

Thanks & Regards,
Sankar
